# Emergencies & After Hours

<Alert type="error">

If your child is experiencing a life-threatening emergency, please **call 911** or
go to your nearest Emergency Room.

If your child has ingested something potentially poisonous, **call poison control at [1-800-222-1222](tel:18002221222)**.

</Alert>

If you would like to reach the on call physician about an urgent matter that
cannot wait until regular office hours, we are available after 5pm on
weeknights, and throughout the weekend. To reach a physician please call our
office at 617-232-2811. If you do not receive a call back in the expected
time, please call our office again.

We are available to see your child for urgent medical issues on Saturday,
Sundays, and holidays. These visits are by appointment. Please call our
office at 617-232-2811 and the on-call physician will call you back either to
give you advice or to schedule an office visit.

We do not use or respond to text messages or emails from patients. We have found that when a family has medical questions, the best way to communicate is in person or by phone. We are always happy talk to you in person or by telephone.

We are available 24 hours/day, 365 days/year to care for our patients. If you
are considering going to an urgent care center please call us first. The best
after-hours care for your child comes from a pediatrician who knows your
child or who works closely with your child's pediatrician.

For weekend appointments your child will be seen in our office or in the
Newton office of our weekend covering group.
