## Telehealth charges for video visits and telephone calls

Please note that with the advent of telehealth, medical care delivered electronically, remotely, or digitally might incur a charge to your insurance plan.

Telehealth has allowed many problems to be managed without an in person visit. But new regulations require physicians to document this work in a patient's chart as medical care.

This type of medical care includes video visits, as well as certain phone calls or electronic messages that encompass medical care.

As always, our first and primary goal is to take the highest quality care of your child.  We will never waiver from this as we all adapt to new ways to deliver this care.

We are happy to answer any questions you have about telehealth charges, but we can't provide answers about insurance plan coverage.  Questions about coverage for telehealth should be directed to your insurance plan.
