# Referrals

There are two kinds of referrals:

**Medical Referral:**  
This means that your pediatrician will recommend that your child see a
specialist for a particular medical problem and help arrange the appointment.

**Insurance Referral:**  
This is the process that our office staff undertakes to ensure that the
specialist visit is covered by your insurance company.

## Medical Referral

Please speak with your child's physician before making an appointment with a
specialist since there are many conditions we can easily treat in our office.

If you need to see a specialist, please call our office and we will assist
you in setting up a specialist appointment.

## Insurance Referral

If your child needs to see a specialist, your insurance company may require a
referral number prior to the visit. Once you have made the appointment with
the specialist, please contact our office with the following information:

- Your child's name, date of birth, and insurance policy information
- Name of the physician specialist who will be seeing your child
- The date of the specialist appointment
- The NPI (National Provider Identifier) number of the specialist. The
  specialist's office will tell you that number, so ask for the NPI number when
  you make the appointment.
