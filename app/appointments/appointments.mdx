# Appointments

We are always happy to see your child when you have any concerns. Please call
and make an appointment for a visit. While we canâ€™t accept walk-ins, we
always have time for scheduled visits. You do not need to check with your
child's physician before making an appointment. Our staff is trained to take
your call and make an appointment.

**We are available to see patients every day of the year.** We are open for
appointments 9am-5pm Monday-Friday. On Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, contact
the office to be seen by appointment.

If you would like to make an appointment for your child, please call our
office at 617-232-2811. 

Interpreter services are available for any appointment upon request. Let us know 
in advance of your appointment if you would like to request interpreter services.

**Note:** We require 24 hours notice to cancel an
appointment. There is a charge for appointments missed without proper
notice.
