## How to Find a Behavioral Health Clinician

- **Contact your insurance company:** All insurances have a dedicated phone number for BH care. Insurance companies keep lists of providers that are considered in network and can direct you to providers who have availability in most cases. Start by calling the number on your insurance card or visit their website to search providers.
- **Contact your school:** Most schools and districts have some type of social emotional support staff. Inquire with your child's teacher, guidance counselor or other school official on the availability of individual and group support they offer. In some cases, a formal plan like an IEP or 504 is NOT needed to access services that can benefit your child.
- **Call the MA Behavioral Health Help Line:** Call 1-833-773-2445. This hotline is operated 24/7, 365 days a year by trained behavioral health providers and peer coaches who offer clinical assessment and treatment referrals.
- **Visit a Community Behavioral Health Center:** There are 26 centers across MA that offer immediate care for mental health needs and are open daily for walk-ins, routine appointments, and crisis care. They offer both in-person and telehealth care.

- **Contact your local board of health:** Some cities and towns may offer BH services through their health departments. Call or visit your town/city health department to inquire about services available to residents.
- **Contact your Employee Assistance Program (EAP):** Some employers contract with an EAP as a benefit to offer support around many topics. If an EAP is available to you, it is likely open to all members of your immediate family. Check with your benefits to see if you have access to EAP services, and if they can provide BH services or assist in the search for a BH provider for your family.
- **Contact a referral service:** The following agencies create and manage a network of therapists and aid families in identifying a provider and connecting. These services are highly sought after, but can be important part of the plan to identify a provider

## Behavioral Health Emergency

In the event of a behavioral health emergency involving your child, it's crucial to take immediate action. Behavioral health emergencies may include situations where a child is a danger to themselves or others or experiencing severe emotional distress. Here's what you should do:

1. **Call 911:** If there is an immediate threat to your child's safety or the safety of others, call 911 or your local emergency number.
2. **Contact the Massachusetts Behavioral Health Line:** Call 1-833-773-2445. This hotline is operated 24/7, 365 days a year by trained behavioral health providers and peer coaches who offer clinical assessment, treatment referrals, and crisis triage services.
3. **Stay Calm:** It's essential to remain calm and provide reassurance to your child. Avoid confrontations or escalating the situation.
4. **Do Not Leave Your Child Alone:** Stay with your child and ensure they are safe until professional help arrives.
5. **Seek Follow-Up Care:** After the immediate crisis has been addressed, seek follow-up care and support from a behavioral health clinician to address the underlying issues and develop a long-term plan for your child's well-being.
