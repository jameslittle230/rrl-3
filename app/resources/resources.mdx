## General Health Forms

At the completion of your child’s routine annual check up, you will receive a general health form which will include up-to-date immunization information. This form can be used for school, camp or sports registration, or proof of health for jobs for teens. Please keep the form you receive in a safe place and make copies to provide to school, camps, or other institutions. We highly recommend that you take a picture of this form on your phone so you have access to this form at all times.

If you need additional forms completed by your physician, fill in as much of the form as you are able and submit them either in person, or in a self addressed, stamped envelope and allow 5-7 business days for completion.

There is a charge to provide you with extra copies of your child’s health form.
