## General Guidance

- Call your OBGYN or pediatrician to see if they have in-office samples or can suggest a similar formula that may be more readily available in stores and is nutritionally similar to your infant’s typical formula.
- You should NOT water down formula, try to make formula at home, or use toddler formula to feed infants. Don’t discard formula unless it is expired or is part of the recall. [Check your formula’s lot code](https://www.similacrecall.com/us/en/product-lookup.html) to see whether or not it was affected by the recall.
- You can find more guidance from the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://healthychildren.org/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Are-there-shortages-of-infant-formula-due-to-COVID-19.aspx).
