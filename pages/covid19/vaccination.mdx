# COVID-19 Vaccination Information for Patients

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is now approved for patients 5 years and
older. **We strongly urge all of our patients 5 years and older to get the
COVID-19 vaccine.**

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a 2 dose vaccine given 21 days apart.
Immunity from the shot occurs 2 weeks after the 2nd dose.

We are not yet a designated COVID-19 vaccination site. If we become a COVID-19
vaccination site we will notify you by email.

## Current Information (Updated 2021-05-16)

1. CONSENT FORM — any patient younger than 18 years is required to show written
consent from a parent or guardian. The parent does not have to be present at the
vaccine appointment but the patient must show the consent form. You can go to
[https://www.mass.gov/lists/ma-consent-forms-for-people-under-18-years-of-age](https://www.mass.gov/lists/ma-consent-forms-for-people-under-18-years-of-age)
to download a consent form. 
2. SIDE EFFECTS — the side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for patients
ages 12-15 are similar to patients ages 16 and older: pain, fever, chills,
fatigue. These side effects are more frequent after the 2nd vaccine. 
3. HOW TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT: 
    * Adults can book an appointment for their child at [https://vaxfinder.mass.gov](https://vaxfinder.mass.gov)
