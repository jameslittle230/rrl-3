following symptoms:

- Fever (100.0 or higher), chills, or shaking chills

## EXPOSURE: My child was exposed to someone who tested positive and feels fine

If your child was exposed to someone with COVID-19 then your child might need to quarantine and possibly get a test. Do not get the test until 4 days have passed from the exposure. 

If your child is exposed to someone with COVID-19 please call our office to learn what to do or refer to this chart for determining the next steps about quarantining from public and testing.

Exposure to COVID-19 is defined as close contact (within 6 feet of someone) for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more in 24 hours with someone who has COVID-19.

## TESTING: How do I get my child tested?

If your child is sick, call the office and we will arrange a drive through
test at Boston Children’s Hospital. If your child is not sick or has been
exposed, you can get tested at many local pharmacies or urgent cares, or find a site at the following websites:

Fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.
