## ILLNESS: If my child is sick, when should I get my child tested for COVID-19?

Your child should get tested for COVID-19 if they are experiencing any of the
following symptoms:

- Fever (100.0 or higher), chills, or shaking chills
- Cough (not due to other known cause, such as chronic cough)
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- New loss of taste of smell
- Sore throat or scratchy throat
- Headache when in combination with other symptoms
- Muscle aches or body aches
- Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
- Fatigue, when in combination with other symptoms
- Nasal congestion or runny nose (not due to other known causes, such as 
  allergies) when in combination with other symptoms

## EXPOSURE: My child was exposed to someone who tested positive and feels fine

If your child was exposed to someone who tested positive, they should **quarantine** and/or **isolate** until they are no longer likely to infect others.

The following table based on the most recent data from the Center for Disease Control describes how your exposed child should quarantine and/or isolate from you and your family, as well as when the isolation/quaratine can end.
