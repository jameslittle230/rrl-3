            Welcome to the office of Drs. Roth, Rotter, and Laster. We are 3
            pediatricians in a small, private practice in Brookline,
            Massachusetts and we are dedicated to taking excellent and personal
            care of our patients. We are all Board Certified by the American
            Board of Pediatrics. We are affiliated with Boston Children's
            Hospital and are proud members of the PPOC (Pediatric Physicians
            Organization at Children's), Boston Children's Hospital's only
            preferred primary care provider network.
          </p>
          <h2>Why choose us?</h2>
          <p>
            Our patients choose us because they know they will get excellent
            medical care in a personalized office. We have access to the most up
            to date pediatric information in the country through our strong
            affiliation with Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, and in our intimate
            office setting we can easily maintain close, long term health
            relationships with our families.
