          Welcome to the office of Drs. Roth, Rotter, and Laster. We are 3
          pediatricians in a small, private practice in Brookline, Massachusetts
          and we are dedicated to taking excellent and personal care of our
          patients. We are all Board Certified by the American Board of
          Pediatrics. We are affiliated with Boston Children's Hospital and are
          proud members of the PPOC (Pediatric Physicians Organization at
          Children's), Boston Children's Hospital's only preferred primary care
          provider network.
        </p>
        <h2>Why choose us?</h2>
        <p>
          Our patients choose us because they know they will get excellent
          medical care in a personalized office. We have access to the most up
          to date pediatric information in the country through our strong
          affiliation with Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, and in our intimate
          office setting we can easily maintain close, long term health
          relationships with our families.
